There was no doubt about it. Lilith Romano was dead. But he decided to stab her one more time, just for good measure. No, no, maybe two more times. Actually, let's make it three! Why not? It wasn't like he had anything better to do. Go, white boy, go! Kill her, white boy! Yeah! Yeah!!! Murdering his sister was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- he only had one sister, so it wasn't like he could do it again -- and he might as well make the most of it. Briefly, he pondered the merits of stabbing a hole straight through her chest. That would be fun, wouldn't it?
